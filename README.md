# SYSC4805-Autonomous-Snowplow-A-13
# Autonomous Snowplow Project

This project is for the Computer Systems Design Lab (SYSC 4805) at Carleton University. The objective is to design, build, and program a robot capable of autonomously clearing snow from an enclosed area according to detailed engineering specifications[attached_image:1][attached_image:3].

## Project Highlights

- **Autonomous Navigation:** Uses multiple sensors to perceive the environment and navigate safely.
- **Obstacle Detection:** Actively avoids both static and moving obstacles placed within the arena[attached_image:3].
- **Efficient Snow Removal:** Plow design and control ensure maximum area coverage and efficiency based on the competition's requirements.
- **Safety Features:** Includes a reliable emergency stop system and adheres to all operational constraints.
- **System Integration:** Emphasizes modular hardware and software design, frequent unit and integration testing, and collaborative project management[attached_image:1][attached_image:3].

All source code, documentation, and required deliverables are organized here to fulfill lab evaluation and demonstration criteria.
